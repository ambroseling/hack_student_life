He stayed there two years, before finishing his studies at the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique de Paris with Sophie Cherrier, assisted by Vincent Lucas and Michel Moragués for Chamber Music. At age 22, while he was still a student at the Conservatoire, he was appointed Principal Flute at the Orchestre de l'Opéra National de Lyon. From 2013 to 2015 he joined the Los Angeles Philharmonic as Principal Flute. In 2015 he returned to France as the Principal Flute with Orchestre de l'Opéra National de Lyon. From 2005 to 2006 he was appointed principal flute of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Thierry Fischer and he temporarily took leave from his orchestra in Lyon, which he rejoined the following year. He is currently the only French flautist to have held this position in a great British Orchestra. A chamber music enthusiast, he is a Laureate of the Barcelona International Sonata Competition. He is also a member of the Faust Wind Quintet, made up of talented representatives of the new generation of French woodwind players (Nicolas Baldeyrou, Nora Cismondi, Julien Hardy and Benoit de Barsony) and accompanied by the famous dancers/choreographers Regine Chopinot and Benjamin Millepied, This group has performed Bach's Partita the world over. He is regularly invited to play with the world renowned Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields in London. His particularly rich musical career has nevertheless left him time to teach.

He moved with his family to Toronto in 1990 and then studied with David Zafer. He also worked with Lorand Fenyves in Toronto, Peter Oundjian in the US, and David Takeno in London, U.K. Daniel co-founded Trio Mondrian, a group that played together from 2007-2019. The trio received first prize at the 2007 International Chamber Music Competition in Trieste, Italy, and performed in prestigious venues including Wigmore Hall, Concertgebouw and La Fenice in Venice. Trio Mondrian has been named a BBT fellowship winner in 2009. Daniel is also a founding member of the Israeli Chamber Project, a chamber group active in both Israel and the USA. One of the biggest passions of Daniel is the chamber orchestra. He has been invited by Tabea Zimmermann to guest lead Camerata Bern, and since then directed numerous projects with Sweden’s Camerata Nordica and Norway’s Norwegian Chamber Orchestra. He was principal violist of the Amsterdam Sinfonietta from 2009 to 2016. In 2017, Daniel became concertmaster of the Basel Chamber Orchestra in Switzerland where he performed “Meta Arca” by Heinz Holliger with the composer conducting. In April 2018 Daniel performed the Dutch premiere of John Woolrich’s “Ulysses Awakes” with the Amsterdam Sinfonietta. Recently, Daniel has been invited by Iván Fischer to be guest concertmaster of the Budapest Festival Orchestra. Equally at home as a violinist and violist, Daniel is invited to play chamber music concerts all across Europe and Israel. He has collaborated with artists such as Menahem Pressler, Antje Weithaas, Shmuel Ashkenzi, Tabea Zimmermann, and performed in festivals such as Prussia Cove, Musikdorf Ernen and Peasmarsh Music Festival. Lastly, Daniel enjoys greatly sharing his passion for music-making with the next generation. He has lead both instrumental and chamber music classes at the Amsterdam Conservatory and at the chamber music sessions of the Jerusalem Music Centre. Daniel plays on a 2020 violin made by Paul Belin from Maintal and a James Tubbs bow generously gifted to him by the late Bud Beyer, a great and inspiring mentor.",

Travel from the Goran Heights to the Mount of Olives to Jerusalem, along the path to Santiago de Compostele and across Turtle Island, such arduous physical travel was then and now thought to prepare the individual for an inward journey towards a better self. Even as we tread on the same worn stones, across the Seas we hear the echoes of those who sang, their voices rippling across as thousands of deaths. We may ask and wonder if the architecture of the human heart has really changed so much. Daniel Taylor and Andrew Balfour join together to lead this sacred event featuring magnificent yet neglected composers. Ispiciwin, meaning “Journey,” embarks on an unprecedented musical exploration at the faculty, bridging cultures and perspectives.",

The intertwining of some aspects of North American economies with NAFTA, and later the USMCA prompted and yet were incapable of handling the massive displacements they generated. While it may be true the solution lies outside of trade deals, and even nation states, with the ethical response an elimination of borders, this talk will focus in the meantime on the potential for more creative and humanitarian responses within the existing policy frameworks, an anti-NAFTA within the existing tri-national policy environment. Centering lived experiences of those directly impacted by NAFTA will enable better, more grounded policy design, even while acknowledging that the existing national policy landscapes continue to generate and sustain structural inequalities and harm.",
