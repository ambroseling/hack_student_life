      "description": "Ace of Architecture (AOA) is a non-profit, multi-platform organization for architectural learning and resource sharing that emphasizes process and care. Initially, as a gathering of architecture lovers, AOA challenges the idea of architecture being only about the making and thus experiments with it as a way of thinking, talking, writing, critiquing, reflecting, and caring. What matters at AOA is the forming of architectural communities, the becoming of architects, and the making of architecture. During its foundational years of 2018-2020, AOA has been largely active among the Chinese architecture students at the University of Toronto and formed a stronger connection between the upper-year and new students. During this period of time, AOA has produced numerous workshops, presentations, discussions, research and online publications (WeChat official account) that have helped hundreds of students transition into an architectural way of learning, improve their professional skills and find their future paths in the field. In 2020, AOA launched a WeChat official account under the same name of Ace of Architecture to overcome the physical restriction due to the pandemic and has brought an even greater student community together with the same objective. The WeChat account has published various articles on faculty introduction, professional interviews, undergrad study planning tips, and student research projects. The AOA Universe of today is divided into the four Chambers of Facts, Tea Party, Competition, and Hypothesis. The Facts Chamber consolidates and iterates productions from the foundational years, centering on the more practical information of university courses, systems, resources, and career planning, run by first-and second-year students. The Tea Party Chamber preserves the tradition of gathering of architecture lovers from universities across North America and Europe in the form of weekly presentations and critiques on current work and research. The Competition Chamber is led by upper-year and grad students to participate in architectural competitions and learn from experience. The Hypothesis Chamber extends into the metaphysical value of architecture and the more daring and challenging topics through researching and writing on architectural history and theory. AOA is the room of requirement for architecture students, where they bring what they can offer and take away what they need, all of which are for the collective they are forming, for the individuals they are becoming, and for the architecture, they are making.",

      "description": "Welcome to the Brain Changes Initiative at the University of Toronto! We are a dedicated chapter of the renowned Brain Changes Initiative, an organization committed to raising funds for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) research and promoting brain health and well-being. Founded by the inspiring Dr. Matthew Galati, who survived a TBI following a motor-vehicle accident that left him in a coma, our organization embodies resilience, advocacy, and education. Dr. Galati’s passion for brain health and his dedication to providing support and resources for individuals with TBI, as well as educating the general public, are the cornerstones of our mission. At the Brain Changes Initiative UofT, we seek students who share a passion for neurogenesis and traumatic brain injury. Join us in our efforts to advance TBI research, support those affected, and promote overall brain health within our community. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of those impacted by TBI and contribute to the broader understanding of brain health.",

We fulfill our mission by distributing gift cards for food enterprises or businesses that carry hygiene products, in the place of distributing cash. For individuals who are homeless, this provides meaningful access to food, water, and care resources. These gift cards will be distributed during monthly student-led outings, facilitated by the club’s executive members. The club will run events and fundraisers throughout the year in order to purchase gift cards which will be distributed during outings. Our ultimate goal is to provide resources for Toronto’s homeless community by collaborating with community partners, and by generating awareness about issues related to homelessness.",

      "description": "The Caribbean Studies Students Union (CARSSU) is the academic student group representing all full-time undergraduate students who are enrolled in a Caribbean Studies course or program at the University of Toronto. The overarching objective of CARSSU is two-fold: (a) to promote and advocate for improvements to the Caribbean Studies program at the University of Toronto (St. George) and provide diverse representation and support for members of the Caribbean Studies Program and (b) to organize with its membership to advocate for the betterment of the Caribbean region and its diaspora, through knowledge sharing in social and community-based programming. CARSSU’s intent is to organize with students to advocate for the betterment of the Caribbean Studies program, while addressing the issues of Eurocentrism and lack of interdisciplinary courses amongst mainstream subject matter. Recognizing that academic experiences are closely linked to the many systemic barriers that students face in academia, CARSSU works to address these issues, while providing a space for critical thought. These spaces include and are not limited to the University of Toronto Journal of Caribbean Studies (Caribbean Quilt) published annually by CARSSU. As the only student organization that both represents Caribbean Studies students, and lobbies for the betterment of those in the region and its diaspora, CARSSU has a unique focus on academics, as well as community and social development. CARSSU strives to not only showcase the complex and profound history, political climate, and socio-cultural environment of the Caribbean region but, also to raise awareness for issues that are affecting the region and continuously hold ourselves accountable as diaspora representatives.",

Through our discussions and resources, we aim to empower cat owners with knowledge about their feline companions, including their behaviors, nutritional needs, grooming requirements, and health concerns. By fostering an environment of learning, we aspire to create responsible cat owners who prioritize the well-being of their feline friends. We understand that owning a cat comes with a set of responsibilities, such as providing a safe and enriching environment, regular veterinary care, proper nutrition, and companionship. Through open conversations, we can exchange tips, share experiences, and support each other in fulfilling these responsibilities to the best of our abilities. In addition to providing a platform for human connections, our club also aims to create opportunities for our feline friends to socialize and interact with other cats. We understand the importance of companionship for cats, and by facilitating meet-ups and playdates, we hope to foster new friendships among our furry companions and enrich their lives.",

      "description": "In 1966, a group of University of Toronto students started Radio University, successfully establishing an independent radio station and voice for the University of Toronto community. The infant radio station grew steadily, building important associations with CJRT-FM and CHUM-FM. By the early 1970s it was clear that Radio University — now Input Radio — was reaching and representing an increasingly diverse audience. Throughout the 1970’s and 80’s, the station maintained its commitment to pursuing the issues and stories ignored by most mainstream news outlets. By doing so Input Radio and its successor CJUT developed a loyal audience in Toronto. The next obvious step was to increase the station’s broadcast range by becoming an FM station. This was accomplished in 1986, and CJUT became CIUT-FM. While continuing to reach both University of Toronto students and the broader Toronto community, the station also found new audiences all across Central and Southern Ontario. Now, thanks to Star Choice’s National Satellite Network and Webcasting through Virtuecast, CIUT-FM is bringing its unique brand of eclectic broadcasting to a global audience. At CIUT FM we feel we’ve earned the right to call ourselves Real Radio. Every day volunteers and donors keep us broadcasting the news, music and information that you won’t hear on commercial radio stations. It’s an accomplishment we’re proud of, and we need you to help us keep it happening. Your time and your donations make sure that CIUT will always be fresh, never canned. So, if community radio matters to you, please, help us keep it real.",

Before every workshop, we send out a theme and props for people to write about, so that they can share their writing in the workshop, this last part is 100% voluntary and not at all needed to participate in the games and discussions. However, we do recommend sending in submissions and sharing them with the club. This is a great opportunity to lose fear of sharing your writing and to receive positive feedback from fellow writers. This club is a welcoming space for those who are trying creative writing for the first time, those who have mostly done academic writing and want to diversify their skills, as well as those who have further experience and simply enjoy sharing with fellow writers.",

For small group activities, a group leader will be assigned to each team (one of our UTC members) and will be responsible for supervising and ensuring the safety of participated members. For large group activities, executives will take the same type of responsibilities as a group leader mentioned above. Every member will be required to fill in a detailed personal survey that includes questions about interests, personality, and ideal type. The activities will pair up people based on their commonality and compatibility, which are determined by the survey, or just random selection. Through our activities, members of our club will have the opportunity to develop close relationships with each other. The product of our group is aiming to provide people with a platform for discovering new friendship and possible stable romantic relationships. We aim to provide a healthy, safe, and convenient environment for students who do not have the chance to seek and find a relationship when they are busy with academics. We aim for an emotional satisfaction within each student which would promote and improve the mental health of each person.",

While diseases associated with dementia are commonly seen today, with the highest prevalence in seniors, they remain vastly misunderstood. Individuals affected by dementia often display unusual social behaviours, leading to feelings of frustration and distress from their family members and friends who may not quite understand why they may act in such ways. Through campaigning, knowledge spreading, and in-person events, this group aims to advocate for the needs of patients suffering from dementia, while elucidating the causes and both behavioural and physiological effects of such diseases. This organization, therefore, aims to contribute to the fight against dementia by spreading knowledge and educating the general population on the biological and sociological components of such prevalent illnesses.",

The Friends of Médecins Sans Frontières – University of Toronto chapter is a student organisation fully affiliated with MSF Canada. Our mandate is to engage with students concerned about humanitarian crises by helping them become aware of MSF and its work around the world. MSF is the world’s leading independent humanitarian relief organisation, delivering aid to people affected by armed conflicts, epidemics, disasters, and lack of equitable access to health care. Doing so in over 60 countries around the world requires the skills and talents of many different professions, including engineers, accountants, and journalists, in addition to nurses and doctors. Friends of MSF seeks to involve students from all faculties, programs, and backgrounds, recognizing that students interested in working for MSF can do so by pursuing a broad variety of career paths, not just those of the medical professions. The primary objectives of the FoMSF UofT chapter are: (1) to raise awareness of the value of humanitarian aid, specifically to the field projects of MSF; (2) to educate students about global health issues and the international response to those issues; and (3) to engage the student population in fundraising that supports the work of MSF Canada. These objectives are pursued through events such as speaker sessions that include MSF staff who have recently returned from field projects, awareness campaigns that bring attention to MSF’s current work and educate students about the global health issues that MSF is responding to, and fundraisers that directly benefit MSF Canada.",

      "description": "In this modern age of in-ear earbuds, chest-pounding concerts, and ear shattering bars and parties, our ears need a friend! If you have ever come home from an event with a ring in your ears, or needed to ask someone to yell so you could hear them, your ears have been tired out (or even damaged). Your hair cells (those that detect sound waves in your cochleas, not the ones on your head, silly) die if they are overworked, and don’t grow back, ever (a long time!). Much of that damage nowadays comes from loud music, which many university students experience almost every week. But now for the good news: all you need to do to preserve your hearing is fill those ears with some foam – earplugs, that is. It protects your hair cells from tiring, makes the music sound cleaner, and even makes it easier to hear others when they talk to you at loud events! At Friends of the Ear, we promote hearing protection (we might even make it cool one day) at events that pose a threat to our ears. We also raise funds for charities that donate hearing aids to those that need them. We tend to take out hearing for granted, but there are those who cannot, and if we can raise enough money to give just one of those people the gift of hearing, we will have accomplished our mission – to be Friends of the Ear.",

These can be panel discussions, guest lectures, or more formal debating events. Whatever the format, students participate with invited speakers and panelists, both in the event itself and in the question and discussion periods which are a part of each event. These events not only provide the student population at large with opportunities for public discussion, they also give committee members and volunteers the chance to learn how to organize and promote such public discussions. Second, the Debates & Dialogue Committee co-operates with the Debating Club in enriching the opportunities for student debating. The Committee organizes several tournaments in House and liaises with the Debating Club over the selection of, and fundraising for, students to represent Hart House in the World Debating Championship. Although these two principal activities are different, they are bound together as ways to enable students to enhance their skills at participating, in the broadest sense, in the wider world of dialogue and expression that sustains our political life and allows for a multiplicity of voices in civil society in general.",

One of the biggest challenges a Korean student faces when first encountering the UofT community is the diversity of the cultures. It’s not easy to blend in when you have been exposed to one culture your whole life.

The club is here to provide information regarding the MCAT, medical school requirements, and other educational pathways so everyone can understand and look for them. We not only provide info for the future, but we can also provide and sponsor other medical-related opportunities, such as bringing more attention to other courses, research opportunities, where to look for opportunities, and even offer a guideline on how to use the University to its max potential, after all, University is an investment in yourself. This club will not only do that but also inspire others to follow their passion by bringing forth researchers, professors, and other fellow students to explain their stories. We believe that by sharing these stories, we can inspire others to pursue their passion in the medical or research field, and we will also bring people outside of the University to bring voice to jobs in the medical field or research field that is not brought to light often.",

Our enthusiasm stems from the understanding that skills fostered through lessons can have long-term benefits beyond our studio. We partner with families in the community to empower lasting confidence and to foster a love of learning in children and youth. We offer weekly one-on-one music lessons in piano/keyboard, guitar, violin, and voice every Saturday and Sunday on the University of Toronto St. George Campus. Lessons begin in October, and each April we give all of our students the opportunity to showcase and celebrate their hard work and growth with an end-of-year recital. Our instructors are a select group of energetic, dedicated student volunteers at the University of Toronto who share a passion for music and love working with kids. This team of experienced individuals have all achieved their Royal Conservatory of Music Grade 8 or higher and have formal education in music theory. If you are interested in volunteering, we would love to hear from you!",

A formal education in music should not be a privilege limited to those who can support it. We feel that music is an integral part of a child’s early development, with benefits reaching far beyond the child’s developmental stage. Vulnerable children should be granted the same opportunities for growth and development that are available to their peers. Through our partnership with the College Montrose Children’s Place, FCJ Refugee Centre, Robertson House, and General Crerar Public School, we bring music to young children who need it the most. We fully subscribe to the concept of music as a developmental tool, and to its beneficial effects on a child’s social, academic, and emotional development. As a youth-driven initiative, the directors of MBCC are strong proponents of “self-help” within a community. The needs of a community are best met by those living in it, and who better to enhance our programs than the youth themselves. Our youth volunteers with significant musical achievement provide mentorship to our participants in group and one-on-one classes. Our approach is two-tiered. While we seek to enhance our children’s educations with the inclusion of music, we also hope to enrich the personal development of our volunteer youths who gain important interpersonal skills, self-enrichment, and fulfillment through their participation in MBCC’s programs. We currently offer private and group instrumental lessons for children aged 7-12 as well as early childhood music appreciation group classes for those aged 3-5, and 0-3. In the constant pursuit of growth, we are always looking to expand our programming!",

      "description": "Our project is about love. Through the work of volunteers, we aspire to: Change the way people travel and start the journey for ordinary tourists to become humanitarians. Prevent the waste of usable medical supplies and get them to those in most need. Not Just Tourists was founded with the purpose of getting medical supplies to those who can’t afford them. Ordinary tourists are given the means to change the lives of the locals they visit. After seeing first-hand the serious lack of medical supplies in Cuba in 1990, Dr. Ken Taylor and his wife Denise—from St. Catharines, Ontario—started taking medical supplies to remote areas in Cuba. Soon others who were traveling to Cuba began approaching them to take medical supplies too, and the Not Just Tourists phenomenon started. Since it’s inception 30 years ago, NJT has spread to chapters across the world, with over 10,000 suitcases and 1,000,000+ lbs of medical supplies and equipment delivered to 82 countries. Not Just Tourists receives donations from Canada’s largest hospitals, clinics, medical suppliers and individuals. The supplies donated are typically gauze, bandages, surgical instruments, masks, gloves, antiseptics, IV kits, urinary supplies and birthing kits. The supplies are packed by volunteers into suitcases during weekly “packing parties”. Travellers sign up and are given the suitcases to deliver to remote clinics where they are needed. The project does not accept funding, is non-political, non-religious. Everything is accomplished through volunteers.",

We aim to deliver educational content on means you can use to reflect on your past accomplishment, start noticing the little things that bring you joy, and eventually allow you to realize how awesome you are! The deliverables will be in the form of open discussion via virtual gathering and onboarding panelists that specialize in the study of positive psychology to provide professional insights.",

Then, three club volunteers put forward objects of beauty and well-thought-out arguments for why they are beautiful. Anyone can bring forward any object of beauty, whether artistic, performed, recorded, physical, bought, or stolen. Then, they give a presentation for what makes them beautiful, drawing on philosophy, aesthetics, or whatever human discipline they like. There are a few short questions after each presentation, and then, after the presentations, there is a general discussion where anyone can ask a question until the end of the meeting. The goal is to help members better find and understand the beauty in the world around them. At each meeting, the conclusions and key points of each discussion and contribute to the Psyche Society’s ethos for that year, which may be published as an annual review at the end of the year. Occasionally we will host events of beauty such as nature trips, music shows, plays, poetry readings and pub nights. You can join, whoever you are, regardless of your academic background, ethnicity, race, religion or language. All the Society’s discussions are held in English, but works of other languages are eagerly welcomed if they are explained clearly. The Society is secular by design, but holds the literary ideal of the goddess Psyche as a symbol of its purpose. Thus, each meeting will begin with a symbolic President’s address to Psyche which members may take part in if they choose. The Psyche society welcomes all members’ beliefs, but has not a dust-mote of tolerance for discourse or acts that attack members in their person or for their belonging to a certain group. Neither do we tolerate any discourse or actions that undermine the effective functioning of the club. Violate these rules and you are out in two shakes of a lamb’s tail. The Society is driven by love for beauty, not to prove anyone’s intelligence or rhetorical skill. It prefers not to host people who only like to hear themselves talk. If you love beauty and want it to take up a greater part in your life, you’re welcome here. The Psyche Society is, at its core, a group of friends and kind compatriots with whom a common enjoyment for beauty is shared. More details will appear close to the clubs fair and inscription date.",

The UofT dance community, despite its apparent size, is in reality quite removed from the larger UofT community. We firmly believe that dance is an art that everyone can appreciate and experience if they should desire to. Often what discourages an individual from dance, especially older individuals, is the exclusivity characteristic of experienced dancers forming closed-off competitive or training teams. Here at REV, we aim to break down such barriers, foster community, as well as promote the beauty of dance without intimidation and stipulation. We host weekly open classes, which any UofT student (or anyone who is willing to pay the Goldring entrance fee) can join. Open classes are led by experienced dancers, whom we know through friends or by association. We believe that UofT, given its size and scope, really benefits from smaller communities set up within, where students feeling lost within a sea of students, can find us, find dance, and find his or her place. This is what we ultimately offer and have been offering for the past few years. Through REV, friendships have flourished, as well as the overall passion for dance. We see our members venture out into the Toronto dance community and take additional classes, join sessions, and befriend dancers on their own after joining REV. Not only are we enriching UofT’s dance community, we also supply Toronto’s dance community with bright and eager dancers.",

We encourage students to learn about, experiment with, and develop proficiency in engineering technology, and promote growth through hands-on experience. RSX proudly represents the University of Toronto at various international competitions, including the University Rover Challenge in Utah, USA, and the European Rover Challenge in Kielce, Poland. For these competitions, we build a 50 kg Mars Rover with a robotic arm and construct scientific payloads for various missions including the search for life! It is our mission to form a multidisciplinary team of engineers dedicated to the development and implementation of innovative technology designed specifically for space exploration. The hostility, unfamiliarity, and unknowns related to environments beyond the Earth’s atmosphere pose significant challenges to engineers and scientists. With a rapidly growing aerospace and robotics industry coupled with increasingly accessible and affordable technology, the underpinning goal of RSX will be to provide all of its members with a comprehensive, practical, and concrete understanding of space exploration to meet these challenges. As space exploration is highly multidisciplinary, RSX will welcome engineers and scientists from diverse backgrounds, interests, and skill sets. However, RSX also welcomes anyone who has an interest in space robotics, regardless of experience level. We believe that anyone who is willing to learn is able to thrive in RSX, and we are happy to foster their growth to become the next scientists and engineers.",

Students interested in the sciences, whether its life sciences or physical sciences, are often required to chose one or two domains they find most interesting out of all the sciences to pursue in depth in university. As a result, students who may have predilections in many different scientific fields, are subsequently limited to only studying one or maybe two of these fields. Yet every subject in science are closely intertwined, and build off of each other to explain greater phenomenons. Consequently, our society aims to bridge this divide between various scientific fields by creating an environment where students come together to exchange knowledge about all of these different fields, offering the members a holistic overview of the sciences as a whole. Besides, this group also serves as an opportunity for its members to dabble in scientific fields other than the one of their major(s), that they might not be familiar with or might have an interest in. In other words, this group is an opportunity to exchange with people who might share different or similar interest, and to learn about other fields, which overall, all tie together. Through social events, you will have the opportunity to network with people, to broaden your field of interest and to promote personal professional/career development.",

      "description": "Founded in May 2011, the Secondary School Interactive Crisis Simulation (SSICSIM) is an annual conference hosted by University of Toronto students for high school level delegates that offers an innovative and unprecedented conference experience. SSICSIM is unique as it solely operates Model United Nations (MUN) style “crisis committees” on a variety of themes including those of a historical, fictional and contemporary nature. Unlike traditional MUN committees, SSICSIM delegates are not only required to debate issues from a static and distinct perspective, but rather they are challenged to “think outside of the box” by responding, adapting, and reacting to evolving scenarios that demonstrate real time crisis situations. As the premier MUN “crisis conference” in Ontario, SSICSIM hosts high school students and faculty from across the province. Among other things, SSICSIM strives to provide high school students an opportunity to: think critically about pressing global issues and our ever changing society; stretch their imaginations to address issues through creative solutions; network with university students; and, develop leadership skills such as public speaking, cooperation, debating and professionalism. Likewise, university students who assist in the planning and execution of this event are provided an opportunity to gain their own leadership experience.",

To combat the difficulties of first-year transitioning, research-backed accountability partner systems are used to connect individuals with other first-year students to increase the likelihood of goal development and execution. Through accountability partners, students have a friend or peer to hold them accountable and create a safe outlet for discussion about adapting to university life. This program was designed with the issues first-year students face in mind. Namely, imposter syndrome, mispredicting the feasibility of tasks, and lack of information on goal setting and organization. Educational workshops and events on personalized study strategies, habit formation techniques, and well-being are also provided to university students throughout the year. STEP prides itself on the vast knowledge across many areas of academic studies that diverse executive members bring. This allows for students in all types of programs to gain advice tailored to their academic route.",

During school this can seem almost impossible as our time is consumed by assignments, tests and papers. However, The Positivity Project has the hopes of changing this! We host bi-weekly events on Zoom centred around de-stressing and positive activities like baking, painting, watching movies, playing games and many more! In addition to this, we share a variety of positive posts through our Instagram page, including positive quotes, stories and articles. We will also be hosting one fundraiser every semester to support mental health organizations. Ultimately, our mission is to help students—who deal with a variety of daily stresses—to focus on the positive aspects of life. Our events are open to anyone who wants to bring some positivity into their lives or help spread it to others!",

We generally meet two evenings a week during both the school year and the summer session, although members are free to attend whichever practices are convenient for them. Throughout the year, we both host and attend tournaments, competing against and traveling to schools from across Canada and the United States. In order to increase accessibility for all members of the club, funds earned through hosting tournaments will be used to offset the travel and registration costs that arise from competing at other universities.",

Our mission is to host educational events featuring industry leaders and experts to spark scientific inquiry and innovation. As a leading research university, UofT is already home to research projects and emerging startups in plant-based proteins, cultivated meat, and precision fermentation. Despite this extensive research ecosystem, there is a notable lack of community support to synergize these efforts. Our chapter seeks to bridge this gap by cultivating a collaborative environment, creating educational programs, and establishing a talent pipeline, and by doing so becoming a cornerstone of the alternative protein ecosystem and a beacon for sustainability.",

Our club is a member of Judo Ontario, and through it Judo Canada, the Canadian Olympic Committee and the International Judo Federation. By philosophy and practice within an academic environment, our club is focused on education and physical culture. Judo as developed by its founder, Jigoro Kano, is designed to be practised in a full-contact manner while maintaining the least possible injury risk to its practitioners. Any techniques designed to purposefully injure or inflict pain on another individual are not tolerated within the club. The two principles “Mutual Welfare and Benefit” and “Maximum Efficiency” underpin all that a judo practitioner does, particularly in protecting the physical and emotional well-being of all participants. Accordingly, practice of Judo leads to development of character, self-confidence, self-discipline, physical fitness and healthy values in relationships with club members and others. We believe that everyone can benefit from our teachings and as such we do our best to support beginners and to initiate the journeys of future practitioners.",

It has shown its high professional, originality, and creativity in promoting their brand recognition and events popularity, and has created numerous outstanding graphic designs in its promotions, including a variety of advertisements, posts, and social-media designs.

      "description": "The Falun Dafa Club at U of T aims to provide an open environment for members and affiliates of U of T to freely practice Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) on campus. Falun Dafa is a traditional Chinese spiritual practice for mind and body. The practice combines five gentle and slow exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the moral principles: Truthfulness “真” (zhen), Compassion “善” (shan), and “Forbearance “忍” (ren). It teaches that these qualities are universal and fundamental, and by assimilating into them, one can attain true wisdom, physical health, and a serene state of mind. As any practitioner can validate with their own experience, Falun Dafa is beneficial for relieving stress and achieving mental & physical well-being. Furthermore, it has a deeper meaning for self-improvement and moral transcendence—to achieve a state of selflessness, greater wisdom, and inner peace. With these simple exercises and powerful moral values, you may find new energy, clarity, and peace of mind. The U of T Falun Dafa Club aims to create an environment for its members to share and improve their experiences in incorporating the values of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance, or in Chinese, 真 (zhen), 善 (shan), and 忍 (ren), in their daily lives. Regular activities include weekly exercises and periodic experience-sharing sessions. Additionally, we host various cultural events to introduce traditional Chinese culture and its deep roots with Falun Dafa. Anyone is welcome to join our sessions regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious background, political beliefs, etc. Participation in all of our activities is on a voluntary basis and free of charge. You are welcomed to join or leave at any time without obligations.",

However, 80% of patients do not have a suitable match in their family, and must find an unrelated donor. Canada’s stem cell donor-database is used to match potential donors to patients. Individuals age 17-35 can register to join this database at stem cell drives, where they swab their cheeks to provide a tissue sample for a DNA test. Finding a match for transplant is difficult: currently, over 1000 Canadians cannot find a match. The Stem Cell Club aims to strengthen Canada’s stem cell donor-database. We seek to recruit the most-needed stem cell donors, and advance health equity by improving representation of non-Caucasians (including Aboriginal Peoples) on Canada’s donor-database. Our club trains students to advocate for patients in need of stem cell transplant, and to develop leadership and teamwork skills. We instruct them to secure informed consent and to identify and correct medical errors. Our goal is to recruit and train hundreds of volunteers to advocate for patients in need of stem cell transplant, and present all students at UofT with the opportunity to register as stem cell donors.",

We are a student-led choir that specializes in singing Mandarin and English songs, bringing together different cultures through the universal language of music. Music is an essential part of any culture, reflecting and shaping societal values and emotions. From the enchanting melodies of traditional Beijing operas to the heartwarming strains of native Taiwanese folk songs, and from the passionate expressions of English Romanticism to the soulful tunes of American country rock, music has the power to connect us all. In today’s rapidly evolving world, where technology often reduces face-to-face interaction, Allegro Choir strives to revive this crucial form of communication. By performing songs that represent Chinese and other cultures, we hope to engage with and celebrate the diverse communities that make up our global society. Since our humble beginnings as a student-led club in 2007, Allegro Choir has grown into a semi-professional ensemble, delighting audiences with our captivating performances. This school year, we will continue our weekly rehearsals and plan to perform at numerous events, culminating in our highly anticipated annual year-end concert. The Allegro Choir is not only about making music; it’s also a supportive and inclusive environment where music enthusiasts can learn new skills, forge life-long friendships, and create cherished memories. We invite all U of T students with a passion for singing and an interest in learning Chinese to join our musical family. Stay tuned to this website and our social media platforms for updates on our performances, behind-the-scenes glimpses, and more exciting news about the University of Toronto Allegro Choir! Happy singing!",

As spirit is also judged in our competition, we challenge our creative side by developing a theme, making costumes, and participating in spirit challenges. Concrete Toboggan provides lots of opportunities for young interested engineers to gain all kinds of practical experience. Team members put their design knowledge to the test on real problems, and then participate in the construction, painting, building, sewing and more. The executive positions help to hone many valuable skills such as engineering design, budgeting, organization, scheduling, and giving formal presentations. On top of all this, it’s a great opportunity to meet similar minded students not just within your school but from schools all across the country.",

Cook or Be Cooked! is a seasonal cooking contest where we invite people to sharpen their knives, put on their chef hats, and heat up their pans to create a fun video letting their cooking and editing talents run wild. A dish for a select culture is chosen and short videos demonstrating the cooking process from groceries to final product and everything in between are displayed for all members (food critics) to see! The best videos are picked by you and their creators will win awesome prizes! Want some more sauce?

We aim to do this by hosting events, seminars, workshops, fundraisers, and other initiatives throughout the year to raise awareness and educate UofT students as well as members of the community on various mental health themes.

      "description": "Our club represents Portuguese and Portuguese-speaking students at the University of Toronto. Every year the University of Toronto Portuguese Association (U.T.P.A.), a group of students who are interested in the Portuguese culture, promote new coming Portuguese and Portuguese-speaking students (and all students) to come to the university to study. Our message is that Lusophone young students can be whoever they would like to become. The UTPA is here to help them on their journey. We show students that university life does not have to be a lonely journey but rather it can be an opportunity to meet new people, to have new opportunities. We get involved in many Outreach programs like Adopt-a-Student Day, our peer mentoring program which allows 1st and 2nd year students to be paired up with upper-year students who are available to guide them through their University journey. We also have a scholarship program every year for new students of Portuguese descent who come to the University to study. Our members are not all necessarily of Portuguese descent – some are Portuguese, most Luso-Canadian and others from other nationalities. Our only requirements to be a member are having an interest in the Portuguese culture, being a dedicated person, and being a team member. It is in the hands of our members to promote our message. Each member has the right to speak out. We have our Social Coordinators that plan events, discuss the details and plan out when, where, and how the event is to happen. Our Secretary stays in contact with other clubs, events, and news, and relays the information to the other group members. The Secretary is also the person who others contact if they want to apply for the scholarship or need specific information about our association. Our Web Designer designs our website, as well as updates it with any news and upcoming events. Our Treasurer is responsible for our financial affairs. He/she controls the expenses versus the profits and is responsible to work out our budgets for our events. The President and Vice-President are the contact people for specific problems or concerns that some may have. They are the people who decide the positions, have the right to decide who is committed and responsible and who is fulfilling their tasks. They are also responsible to get the club’s recognition and any specific campus rights they may require. Above all, all of our members are students themselves, so we have to balance our duties and schedules, which is not an easy task. We are all friends and we enjoy being part of a small but growing group. Many other students are aware of us and get involved during an event, but decide that they do not have the time to attend the meetings of the UTPA. For the members who are part of the UTPA, it is a comfortable and fun environment. It is a chance to make new friends and to plan and develop new contacts. We celebrate every ending UTPA year with a scholarship dinner, our “Primavera Gala” at which we reward our Luso-Canadian scholarship winners who have been admitted to the University of Toronto. They are also featured in our annual magazine, “Origens”, which includes all of our events during that school year and news that may be important for anyone who is interested in joining. This year the UTPA is hoping to have a fantastic year; one that we can make the founders and past members of the UTPA proud of. We will leave the constitution with a few words that one of our past members had expressed towards the UTPA: “In a school that is so big and where it seems that you are outnumbered, where everyone seems to be successful and where many times you feel lost, having a place to belong like the UTPA has made me comfortable and confident. It has made my university years much easier. Thank you UTPA team.” a Luso-Portuguese, previous UTPA member.",

We will examine texts from Oscar Wilde, Shakespeare and other classical theatre writers. We put on the shows for training purposes and for the purpose of making showreels to step into the acting industry career. We will coordinate show dates and workshops with dramatists, directors and actors in the theatre industry. There is a ten dollar membership fee which will be used to buy props and other necessary tools to run the club. We also do playwriting workshops which leads to a student written play being staged. This is a good opportunity for members to invite artistic directors to come and watch their shows to see their acting and their playwriting skills. These original plays will be chosen by votes from all of the members, Preferences are plays that will have enough characters for all of the club members to show their talents and skills. Meetings will be held regularly and members are expected to attend at least one of the two events each month and all of the rehearsals which will be scheduled after taking votes from all of the members. All of our performances will be recorded using a phone camera and will be shared with all of the members after gathering consent. This is a theatre company with a bright future, students will no longer have to wait four years to graduate in order to join an ensemble. University of Toronto will have its own theatre company which produces shows that its community wants and needs. We will learn the importance of team work in an ensemble, we will learn our own strengths and weaknesses, and we will find our inner artist together. Are you planning to step into the acting industry? Have you tried auditioning but you do not have the resources to get recognized? From Headshots to CV to showreels and self tapes. It can be overwhelming, but do not worry. We all have been there. This club aim to ease your journey into the acting and theatre industry.",

One of the things we’re hoping to do is to bring in community leaders (i.e, people who run shelter homes, rehabilitation centres, or food banks) to share their first hand experiences on a particular social issue, and to then educate us on the best way we can support them. An example of this could involve deploying a team to volunteer with the organization for several days, or alternatively, organizing fundraisers to support the cause through monetary contributions or item donations. We were motivated to develop this initiative in response to the significant rise in homelessness and other hardships experienced by Torontonians due to the recent increase in cost of living.",

We provide an inclusive space where women can actively contribute and gain hands-on experience in effecting positive change within our school community, the greater Toronto area, and globally. At WAO, we believe in the power of collaboration and collective action. Our organization is divided into two councils—the Advocacy Council and the Outreach Council—to effectively address the diverse range of women’s issues that are important to our community. By fostering abundant opportunities for involvement at various levels, we strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone who wishes to contribute can find their place. Our shared goal, women helping women, unites us as a community of like-minded, dedicated individuals, providing the necessary support and tools to create lasting change. In the past year, we proudly raised $1,300 for Clan Mothers Healing Village, a Canadian-Indigenous organization dedicated to supporting Indigenous survivors of sexual assault, abuse, and trauma through traditional Indigenous practices and methods. We are thrilled to continue this impactful work in the coming year, and we are excited to announce our second annual Women Helping Women Convention, scheduled for March 3rd, 2024, at Hart House! This convention will serve as a platform for education, inspiration, and connection, bringing together individuals passionate about advancing women’s rights and well-being.",

The primary goal of this initiative is to increase knowledge of educational, extracurricular, and financial opportunities for students of low-income immigrant or refugee background. Presentations on academic success, secondary and post-secondary education, and extracurriculars will be provided to students in the program. Additionally, this program aims to address food insecurities students may face by providing them with a meal and take-home snacks at each group-mentorship meeting. To run this initiative, students from the University of Toronto will be recruited to volunteer their time to mentor and supervise the mentees. Members may have roles in contacting sponsors, making presentations, supervising the meetings, or logistical tasks. This club will work with external sponsors in the community to provide the mentees with food. The mentorship meetings will take place twice a month at pre-booked rooms at the University of Toronto to expose the student participants to a post-secondary setting and at the middle school(s) we are partnering with. This program will be launched with 7-15 mentees in the fall/winter semester of the school year. Ultimately, Youth Food for Thought focuses on mitigating the barriers that typically hinder low-income students’ involvement in higher education.",
